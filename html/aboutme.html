        <h2>Childhood </h2>
        <p1> I was born July 4th, 2004 in Keokuk, Iowa. My childhood home was in Farmington, Iowa where I lived with my 3 older siblings, Tristan, Maddy, and Jordan, alongside my Mom. We lived there until I was around 5 or 6 and moved to Fairfield, Iowa where my mom had my younger brother Jack, (convinently on my birthday  might I add), but we only lived there for about a year. Then, we moved to Batavia, Iowa when I was 7 which is where I consider to be my actual childhood home because I remember it most as we lived there until I was 17. We then moved to the house we live in now which is in Ottumwa, Iowa.  </p1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p1>I went to Cardinal Community School District which is located in Eldon, Iowa from 2nd grade all the way until my graduation in May of 2022. Upon graduation, I knew I wasn't ready to move away for college to some university and I also knew at the time I had no idea what I wanted to go to college to persue. This led to me deciding to stay home and save a lot of money by attending Indian Hills Community College which is located a very convient 5 miles from my house. Since starting at IHCC Fall Term, I have switched my major about 4 times, but have finally discovered what I'm actually interested in which is Interactive Media with a focus in email/social media marketing.  </p1>
